# iBus-micro-brushed-decoder
tiny decoder for running brushed motor powered small RC aircraft from an iBus receiver

provides PWM output for servos plus ESC brushed motor outputs via an external MOSFET per channel, for directly driving one or two small brushed motors. In this way an entire 4(+) channel RC setup can be achieved with just a tiny iBus receiver and an arduino nano board, weighing just a cuple of grams combined.

Initially developed to RC enable a small toy 'plane, with a small motor on each wing and minature servos for ailerons and elevator. Yaw control is achieved by varying the relative  motor speeds, so no need for a rudder.
